I think it'd be really interesting to learn more about Machine Learning and Neural Networks
    I was originally interested in software development because Video Games, but as time went on I began to enjoy programming more and more for itself rather than a means to enter the gaming industry.
    It would be interesting to develop a mobile app someday

### Technical Background

As of writting this, I have completed CIS 241 - System Level Programming and Utilities, CIS 162 - Introduction to Programming I, CIS 163 - Introduction to Programming II and MTH 225 - Discrete Structures which has given me a rudementary understanding and appreciation for programming and experience in Java and C. I am currently enrolled in CIS 263 - Data Structures and Algorithms, and CIS 350 - Introduction to Software Engineering.
